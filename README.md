# Atom
> Get Atom to go to the correct line when opening a file from Unity

### Atom Editor
Get the [app](https://atom.io/) or contribute on [github](https://github.com/atom/atom).

### Installation
Make sure that the `Atom.cs` file is placed under an `Editor` folder in the project. A good place would be in `/Assets/Plugins/Editor/Atom.cs`.

### Usage
Once the Atom file is in place, go to `Unity Preferences` -> `External Tools` -> `External Script Editor` and select your Atom installation.
